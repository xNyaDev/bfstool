//! `bfstool` is a library to interact with Bugbear (BZF and BFS) archives
//!
//! BZF and BFS archives are present in all games and tech demos developed by Bugbear Entertainment
//! except Glimmerati (Nokia N-Gage).
//!
//! This library guarantees support for official files and provides support for custom files
//! on a best-effort basis. Sometimes specific behaviour is required to support unofficial files,
//! in which case all the required changes are documented.
//!
//! # Example apps
//!
//! 3 example apps using bfstool will be provided:
//! - [x] `bfstool-cli` - Command-line application to interact with BFS archives providing advanced
//!   functionality, perfect for various automations as well as power users
//! - [ ] `bfstool-tui` - Command-line application with a terminal user interface providing most
//!   options a regular user requires
//! - [ ] `bfstool-gui` - [egui](https://www.egui.rs/)-based application providing the same
//!   functionality as `bfstool-tui`
//!
